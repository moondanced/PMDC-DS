# Feature Selection and FDR Control in High-Dimensional Data

This repository contains a collection of R scripts designed for feature selection and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in high-dimensional data. The scripts implement various methods such as PMDC-DS, PMDC-MDS, REDS, and Knockoff-PMDC, and are used for simulations and analyses in drug resistance studies.

## Overview
The scripts in this repository are designed to perform feature selection and FDR control in high-dimensional datasets. They are particularly useful in scenarios where the number of features (e.g., genetic markers) is much larger than the number of samples. The methods implemented include:

- **PMDC-DS**: Projection-based Martingale Difference with Data Splitting.
- **PMDC-MDS**: Projection-based Martingale Difference with Multiple Data Splitting.
- **REDS**: Robust Estimation with Data Splitting.
- **Knockoff-PMDC**: Knockoff framework combined with PMDC for FDR control.
- **PMDD-BHq**: Application of PMDC statistics to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

## Script Descriptions
The scripts are categorized based on their functionality:

## Usage
To run the simulations or analyses, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the environment**: Ensure you have R installed along with the necessary libraries (`mvtnorm`, `MASS`, `knockoff`, `Matrix`).
2. **Run the main script**: Execute `main.R` to start the simulation. Modify the parameters in `main.R` to customize the simulation settings.
   
   **Example command:**
   ```r
   source("main.R")
   ```
   
3. **Analyze the results**: The results are saved as `.RData` files, which can be loaded and analyzed in R.
